# Overview

This repository contains proofs and programs related to [Sturmian words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturmian_word).
It is written in [Pecan](https://github.com/ReedOei/Pecan), an automated theorem prover.

## Files

- `automata/`: A directory containing pre-built versions of many of the automata we use to prove theorems about Sturmian words (e.g., palindromes, squares, etc.)
- `ostrowski-automata/`: A directory containing automata used to define Sturmian words and Ostrowski numeration system, as well as some smaller helper predicates (e.g., `bounded_by`).
- `ostrowski_defs.pn`: Using the automata in `ostrowski-automata/`, defines the basic predicates needed to make statements about Sturmian words using Ostrowski numeration systems.
- `ostrowski_props.pn`: A bunch of propositions that should hold about the predictes in `ostrowski_defs.pn`; basically, it's a sanity check.
- `ostrowski_aut.pn`: A file defining the automata needed to prove the theorems in `ostrowski_thms.pn`. This file exists because it's convenient to cache the automata as they can take a long time to build. It tends to be mostly commented out, because rerunning the whole file takes many hours.
- `ostrowski_thms.pn`: The file containing all the theorems we've proven about Sturmian words using Pecan. It heavily relies on the automata generated by `ostrowski_aut.pn`. It is also mostly commented out because it also takes a long time to run all the way through.
